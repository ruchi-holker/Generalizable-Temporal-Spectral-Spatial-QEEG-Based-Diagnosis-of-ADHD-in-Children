NEURAL: A Neonatal EEG Feature Set in Matlab
Matlab code to generate a set of quantitative features from multichannel EEG recordings. Features include amplitude measures, spectral measures, and basic connectivity measures (across hemisphere's only). Also, for preterm EEG (assuming gestational age < 32 weeks), will generate features from bursts annotations (e.g. maximum inter-burst interval). Burst annotations require a separate package, also available on github.
